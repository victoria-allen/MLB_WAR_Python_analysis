# MLB_WAR_Python_analysis
A Python analysis that explores MLB data.

This project is for learning purposes.
## Objective
MLB contracts are higher than other sports. I wanted to try and find if there was any connection between player contract and player performance. This was assesed by using the WAR statistic.
 
## Data
The data used in this project was conpiled from information from [Baseball-Reference.com](https://www.baseball-reference.com/). See the Project Brief document for sources.

Spatial data in the form of .geojson and .json files were used for spatial analyses. These files can be found in the '02 Data' file. 

## Tools
For this project the following tools, programs, and applications were used:
* Excel - for intial data collection
* Python - for analysis
* Jupyter notebooks - for scripts
* Tableau - for visualizations
